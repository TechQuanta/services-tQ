# === USER-AGENT: Global Rules ===
# Apply rules to all search engine crawlers (Googlebot, Bingbot, etc.).
User-agent: *

# === DISALLOW: Nothing Blocked ===
# We want search engines to crawl all public content, including:
# / (Homepage)
# /testimonials
# /faqs
# /work
# (The #pricing anchor tag on the homepage is automatically crawled with the homepage)
# We can explicitly Disallow known low-value paths if they exist (e.g., hidden admin paths).
# Assuming you have no hidden admin paths, we keep this section minimal.

# === SITEMAP: Essential for SEO ===
# This line tells all crawlers the exact location of your XML sitemap, which is crucial for discovering all your important pages.
